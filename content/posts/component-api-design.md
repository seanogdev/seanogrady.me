# Component API Design: The Art of Developer-Friendly Interfaces

The success of a component library isn't measured by how many features it has, but by how easily developers can use those features correctly. A well-designed component API feels intuitive, guides users toward best practices, and makes common tasks simple while keeping complex tasks possible. A poorly designed API, no matter how powerful, creates friction, confusion, and bugs.

After years of building and maintaining component libraries across React, Vue, and web components, I've learned that component API design is a craft that requires balancing competing concerns: simplicity vs. flexibility, explicitness vs. convenience, and consistency vs. optimization.

## The Principle of Least Surprise

The most important principle in component API design is the Principle of Least Surprise: your component should behave the way developers expect it to behave based on their existing knowledge and the conventions of your ecosystem.

If you're building a `Button` component in React, developers expect to be able to pass an `onClick` handler. They expect `disabled` to be a boolean prop. They expect `children` to render as the button text. Violating these expectations—maybe by using `onPress` instead of `onClick`, or requiring `label` instead of `children`—creates unnecessary cognitive load.

This doesn't mean you can never introduce new patterns. It means you should have a very good reason when you do, and you should make the benefits obvious.

## Props: The Foundation of Your API

Props are the primary way developers interact with your components, so getting them right is crucial. Here are the key considerations:

**Use TypeScript types or PropTypes to define clear contracts.** Your component's API should be self-documenting. When a developer types `<Button ` in their editor, autocomplete should reveal all available props with descriptions. This only happens when you properly type your components.

**Prefer specific types over generic ones.** Don't accept `string` when you mean `'small' | 'medium' | 'large'`. Union types make invalid states impossible and guide developers toward correct usage.

**Make required props obvious.** If your component can't function without certain props, mark them as required in your types. Don't default to `undefined` and then throw runtime errors—fail at compile time instead.

**Provide sensible defaults.** Every optional prop should have a default value that represents the most common use case. If 90% of buttons in your app are `variant="primary"`, make that the default so developers only specify `variant` when they need something else.

**Avoid boolean props when the behavior might expand.** Today you have `small` and `large` buttons, so you create a `small` boolean prop. Tomorrow you need `medium` and `xlarge`. Now you're stuck with an awkward API. Start with `size="small" | "medium" | "large"` from day one.

## The Composition vs. Configuration Debate

One of the biggest decisions in component API design is whether to favor composition (building complex UIs from simple components) or configuration (exposing many props on a single component).

Consider a `Card` component. The configuration approach might look like this:

```jsx
<Card
  title="Article Title"
  subtitle="Published on Jan 1, 2024"
  image="/image.jpg"
  actions={[
    { label: 'Edit', onClick: handleEdit },
    { label: 'Delete', onClick: handleDelete },
  ]}
  showDivider={true}
  padding="large"
/>
```

The composition approach looks like this:

```jsx
<Card padding="large">
  <CardImage src="/image.jpg" />
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Article Title</CardTitle>
    <CardSubtitle>Published on Jan 1, 2024</CardSubtitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardDivider />
  <CardActions>
    <Button onClick={handleEdit}>Edit</Button>
    <Button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</Button>
  </CardActions>
</Card>
```

Configuration is simpler for common cases. Composition is more flexible for edge cases. The best component libraries use both: simple components with configuration props for common patterns, plus composable subcomponents for flexibility.

Radix UI and Headless UI excel at this balance. Their components expose both high-level configured versions and low-level composable primitives, letting developers choose the right abstraction for their use case.

## Render Props, Slots, and Customization

Sometimes developers need to customize part of your component without rewriting the whole thing. This is where render props (React), slots (Vue), and similar patterns shine.

Consider a `Select` component. You might want to customize how each option is rendered—maybe adding an icon or multiple lines of text. A render prop makes this possible:

```jsx
<Select
  options={users}
  renderOption={(user) => (
    <div>
      <Avatar src={user.avatar} />
      <div>
        <div>{user.name}</div>
        <div>{user.email}</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )}
/>
```

But render props can become verbose for simple cases. Offer both: a simple string-based API for common cases and a render prop for customization:

```jsx
// Simple case: just display the label
<Select options={['Red', 'Blue', 'Green']} />

// Custom case: full control
<Select options={users} renderOption={(user) => <UserOption user={user} />} />
```

## Event Handlers and Callbacks

Event handler naming should follow your framework's conventions. In React, that's `onEventName`. In Vue, it's `@event-name`. Don't invent your own convention.

Beyond naming, think carefully about what data your event handlers receive. The most common pattern is to pass the relevant data as the first argument:

```jsx
<Select onChange={(value) => handleChange(value)} />
```

For more complex events, pass an object with named properties:

```jsx
<DateRangePicker
  onChange={({ startDate, endDate, isComplete }) => {
    // isComplete tells you if both dates are selected
  }}
/>
```

This is more verbose but self-documenting and easier to extend without breaking changes.

One mistake I see often: components that pass the raw DOM event when the developer really wants the component's value. If you're building a custom `Input`, `onChange` should receive the input's value, not the `ChangeEvent`. Developers can always access the raw event via `onChangeCapture` if needed, but 99% of the time they just want the value.

## Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components

React developers will be familiar with this concept, but it applies to any framework with reactive state. A controlled component's state is managed by the parent; an uncontrolled component manages its own state.

```jsx
// Controlled: parent manages state
<Input value={value} onChange={setValue} />

// Uncontrolled: component manages state
<Input defaultValue={initialValue} onBlur={(value) => save(value)} />
```

Support both patterns. Controlled is better for forms with complex validation and interdependent fields. Uncontrolled is simpler for basic cases. Many components can detect which mode they're in: if `value` is provided, operate as controlled; if `defaultValue` is provided, operate as uncontrolled.

The key is consistency. If your component accepts both `value` and `onChange`, it should work the same way as every other controlled component in your ecosystem.

## Refs and Imperative APIs

Sometimes declarative props aren't enough. You need to imperatively call methods on a component—maybe to focus an input, trigger an animation, or access underlying DOM nodes.

In React, use `forwardRef` and `useImperativeHandle` to expose a clean imperative API:

```jsx
const Input = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focus: () => inputRef.current.focus(),
    select: () => inputRef.current.select(),
    get value() {
      return inputRef.current.value;
    },
  }));

  return <input ref={inputRef} {...props} />;
});
```

Now developers can `inputRef.current.focus()` without needing to know about your internal DOM structure.

Keep imperative APIs minimal. If you can accomplish something declaratively with props, that's almost always better. Reserve imperative methods for operations that can't be expressed declaratively or where the declarative version would be awkward.

## Consistency Across Your Component Library

Individual component APIs might be well-designed, but if they're inconsistent with each other, your library will feel disjointed and hard to learn.

Establish conventions and apply them everywhere:

- Sizing props: always `size="small" | "medium" | "large"`
- Variants: always `variant="primary" | "secondary" | "tertiary"`
- Loading states: always `loading={boolean}` and `loadingText={string}`
- Disabled states: always `disabled={boolean}`
- Event handlers: always follow framework conventions

When developers learn one component, they should be able to predict how others work. The `Button` size API should match the `Input` size API. The `Select` loading state should match the `Table` loading state.

Document these conventions in your design system guidelines so contributors maintain consistency as the library grows.

## Testing Your API Design

The best way to validate your component API is to use it. Before finalizing a design:

**Build realistic examples.** Don't just test that the component works in isolation. Build actual UI patterns you'd see in your application. Does the API feel natural? Are you fighting it?

**Have other developers try it.** You're too close to your own work to evaluate it objectively. Watch someone else use your component. Where do they get confused? What do they try that doesn't work?

**Write documentation first.** Before implementing a component, write the documentation and examples. If the docs are confusing, the API probably is too.

**Check the bundle impact.** A flexible API is worthless if it balloons your bundle size. Use tools like Bundle Analyzer to ensure your API design doesn't force users to ship unnecessary code.

## Evolution and Breaking Changes

Component APIs will evolve. Requirements change, better patterns emerge, mistakes become apparent. Managing this evolution gracefully is crucial.

**Use semantic versioning.** Minor versions add features backward-compatibly. Major versions can introduce breaking changes. Patch versions only fix bugs.

**Deprecate before removing.** When you need to change an API, deprecate the old version first. Log warnings in development mode. Give developers time to migrate before removing the old API entirely.

**Provide codemods when possible.** For breaking changes, automated migration scripts (codemods) make upgrading less painful. Tools like jscodeshift make this feasible.

**Version your components.** Some teams maintain multiple major versions simultaneously, giving teams more time to migrate. This is more work but can be worth it for widely-used libraries.

## Final Thoughts

Component API design is as much about empathy as it is about technical skill. You're designing for other developers, including future you. Every prop name, every default value, every callback signature is an opportunity to make their work easier or harder.

The best component APIs disappear. Developers don't think about the API—they think about their product. The components just work the way they expect, and they can focus on solving business problems instead of fighting their tools.

That's the goal: invisible, intuitive, empowering APIs that feel like a natural extension of the framework. It's not easy, but it's worth the effort.
